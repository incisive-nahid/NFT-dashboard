# Minor_NFT-Sales_Anaysis_Dashboard

The objective of this solution is to create dashboard that can visualize NFT Data and grab insights from it that can help buyers as well as Sellers.
In the real market there has been very less platforms that shows the list of all the NFT transactions at one place with all its details and validity. One has to go individually to check the validity and to know about the history of that NFT. Our platform will be a blueprint of how NFT has been passed on from ages and how the pattern and the demand has increased of each item that can be expressed or bought using NFT.
At the end of the project, we aim to analyze the data obtained from OpenSea about NFT and take out some proper observation and prepare a real-time dashboard accordingly. This would help people from liquidity trap and will kind of help organizations or people to invest properly. This would let people know about all the trends happening in NFT and what would be beneficial to them using pictorial representation that is data visualization.
The goal of the project is to analyze the relevance, interaction and market value of NFT-collections (Non-Fungible Token) using various metrics.
In our project the value of different NFTs is being measured and predicted using exploratory data analysis of market data and social media interaction. The project results in an analysis tool to predict potential buy and sell signals on NFTs and a dashboard that clearly and concisely shows the relevant metrics around NFTs and thus provides a way for easier comparisons of different NFTs.
